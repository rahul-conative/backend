# Scalable E-commerce Backend

Production-grade modular monolith for a Flipkart/Amazon-style backend using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, BullMQ, and Elasticsearch.

## Architecture

- Modular monolith with microservice-ready boundaries.
- DDD-lite module shape for every domain:
  - `controllers`
  - `services`
  - `repositories`
  - `routes`
  - `validation`
  - `models`
- Multi-database strategy:
  - MongoDB: users, products, carts, notifications, analytics
  - PostgreSQL: orders, order items, payments, seller KYC
  - Redis: caching and queues
- Service-layer communication only. No module reaches into another module's database directly.

## Modules

- Auth: JWT access/refresh tokens, refresh session rotation, and Google/Firebase social login verification
- User: profile retrieval, updates, user KYC workflows, and referral identity
- Product: catalog management, Elasticsearch indexing, and reservation-aware stock fields
- Cart: cart and wishlist persistence
- Order: PostgreSQL-backed order creation with server-side pricing and lifecycle transitions
- Payment: Razorpay order creation, signature verification, and webhook handling
- Seller: seller onboarding plus KYC submission/review
- Notification: email/SMS/push-ready notification persistence and queueing
- Analytics: event capture and aggregation-ready event log
- Inventory: reservation, release, commit, and restock flows
- Pricing: coupon engine and centralized total calculation
- Wallet: balance ledger, held credits, capture/release flow, and referral rewards
- Platform: HSN codes, categories, product families, variants, geography, and CMS management
- Warranty: warranty registration, claims, and lifecycle management
- Tax: invoice generation and tax reporting

## Migration Strategy

- Replace each module route group with an API gateway route when extracting services.
- Swap module-internal service invocations for async events or HTTP/gRPC contracts.
- Move the in-memory event bus to Kafka without changing controller contracts.
- Keep event names stable and versioned through `src/contracts/events`.
- Let PostgreSQL-backed modules publish through the outbox first, then replace the outbox consumer with a broker publisher.
- Split workers into standalone processes first, then extract the owning module.
- Preserve repository interfaces so data-layer rewrites stay inside the module.

## Social Login Notes

- Web clients should obtain a Google ID token from Google Sign-In and send it to `POST /api/v1/auth/social`.
- Mobile apps can send either a Google ID token or a Firebase ID token after authenticating with Firebase Auth.
- The backend verifies the identity token itself; clients are never trusted based on profile payload alone.
- Configure `GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS` with all approved web/android/iOS client IDs.
- Configure Firebase server credentials with `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, and `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`.

## Security Notes

- No backend is "unhackable"; the goal is layered defense and rapid detection.
- Refresh tokens are rotated and stored as hashed sessions instead of raw token strings.
- Auth endpoints are rate-limited.
- Security-sensitive auth events are stored in MongoDB for investigation and alerting.

## Razorpay Notes

- `POST /api/v1/payments/initiate` creates a provider order and returns checkout metadata for the client.
- `POST /api/v1/payments/verify` verifies the payment signature server-side after checkout success.
- `POST /api/v1/payments/webhooks/razorpay` handles trusted gateway webhooks for captured or failed payments.
- Set `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, and `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` before enabling the gateway.

## KYC Notes

- Seller KYC supports PAN, GST, Aadhaar, document URLs, and base64/data-URI uploads with review states.
- User KYC supports PAN, Aadhaar, document URLs, and base64/data-URI uploads for regulated payment/identity flows when needed.
- KYC document uploads accept `application/pdf`, `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, and `image/webp` up to `MAX_DOCUMENT_UPLOAD_BYTES` bytes; the JSON body limit defaults to `10mb`.
- Admin review routes allow moving KYC records through `under_review`, `verified`, or `rejected`.
- This project stores KYC workflows and documents metadata; it does not yet call external government verification APIs.

## Realtime Notes

- Socket.IO is attached to the main server and authenticates with the access token.
- Connected users automatically join `user:<id>` and `role:<role>` rooms.
- Clients can subscribe to an order room using `join:order`.
- Current live events include:
  - `order:created`
  - `order:status`
  - `payment:initiated`
  - `payment:verified`
  - `payment:failed`
  - `payment:update`
  - `notification:new`
  - `kyc:submitted`
  - `kyc:status`
  - `admin:kyc:update`

## Commerce Logic Notes

- Orders no longer trust client-provided totals; pricing is calculated on the server from product data.
- Coupons are validated centrally and usage is tracked.
- Inventory is reserved when an order is created, committed on successful payment, and released on payment failure.
- Returns can restock previously committed inventory.
- Wallet credits can be held against an order and either captured on success or released on failure/cancel.
- Referral codes can reward both the referrer and the new user through wallet credits.
- Tax calculation now returns CGST/SGST for intra-state orders and IGST for inter-state orders based on `BUSINESS_STATE`.

## Scale Notes

- Add read replicas and partitioning for PostgreSQL payment/order workloads.
- Add Redis caching around hot product/category/search endpoints.
- Push search reads to Elasticsearch instead of MongoDB listing for large catalogs.
- Run app and workers independently behind autoscaling.
- Add distributed tracing and a central config service as the next enterprise step.
