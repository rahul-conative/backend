# Ecommerce API, Integration, and Design Documentation

This document explains how the ecommerce backend, admin panel, and seller panel should be designed and integrated. It is written for a team of three developers, each with around two years of development experience.

The purpose of this document is to give the team a clear API map, frontend integration direction, module ownership, delivery timeline, and future enhancement plan.

## Project Context

The project is a modular ecommerce platform with separate responsibilities for backend APIs, admin panel workflows, seller panel workflows, and future customer-facing features. The backend is built as a modular monolith with clear module boundaries, which means each business area has its own routes, controllers, services, repositories, validation, and models.

The current API base prefix is:

```text
/api/v1
```

For example:

```text
POST /api/v1/auth/login
GET  /api/v1/admin/dashboard/overview
GET  /api/v1/sellers/me/profile
```

## Team Structure

The team has three developers. Since each developer has around two years of experience, the schedule should include time for code review, bug fixing, API mismatch fixes, and integration support.

| Developer | Primary Area | Secondary Support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Developer 1 | Backend APIs, database, RBAC, third-party services | API documentation and deployment |
| Developer 2 | Admin panel | Backend API verification and QA support |
| Developer 3 | Seller panel | Admin panel shared components and QA support |

## Development Rules

The backend API should be completed before the panel screen is marked complete. A frontend screen should not be considered done if it is still using fake data, old API paths, or unused API references.

Every feature should follow this delivery flow:

1. Backend route, validation, service, and repository.
2. Permission and role check.
3. Postman request added or updated.
4. Admin panel or seller panel integration.
5. Loading, empty, success, and error states.
6. Manual QA with real login token.
7. Short documentation update.

## API Response Standard

All APIs should follow one common response format so the admin panel and seller panel can reuse one API handler.

Successful response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": {},
  "meta": {
    "total": 0,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20
  }
}
```

Error response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation error",
  "details": []
}
```

The frontend should read errors in this order:

1. `response.data.message`
2. `response.data.error`
3. First validation message from `response.data.details`
4. Generic fallback message

## Authentication Design

The platform uses JWT-based authentication. Login APIs return access tokens and refresh tokens. The access token should be sent on protected APIs.

```text
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

Main login users:

- Super-admin
- Admin
- Sub-admin
- Seller
- Seller sub-admin
- Customer/user

Super-admin is seeded by script and should exist in both the authentication storage and the required role/permission storage. Super-admin is responsible for creating admins and managing platform-level access.

## Role and Permission Design

The system uses RBAC and action-based authorization.

Role examples:

- `super_admin`
- `admin`
- `sub_admin`
- `seller`
- `seller_sub_admin`
- `user`

Permission examples:

- `rbac:add`
- `rbac:update`
- `rbac:view`
- `catalog:manage`
- `catalog:review`
- `order:manage`
- `kyc:review`
- `analytics:view`

The frontend should not hardcode feature visibility only by role name. Menus should be shown based on the modules and permissions returned from the backend.

## Admin Panel Integration Design

The admin panel should use one centralized API tool. API URLs should not be hardcoded inside pages.

Recommended frontend structure:

```text
src/_tools/endpoints.js
src/_tools/ApiThunk.js
src/_tools/axiosProvider.js
src/_tools/adminApi.js
src/Redux/adminCoreSlice.js
src/Redux/userManagementSlice.js
src/Redux/sellerSubAdminsSlice.js
```

Admin panel should support these workflows:

- Super-admin login.
- Admin login.
- Dashboard overview.
- Admin and sub-admin management.
- Permission management.
- Seller approval and status management.
- User management.
- Product moderation.
- Order management.
- Payment and payout management.
- Tax, invoice, and report management.
- Platform settings.
- System health and queue monitoring.

Admin panel menu visibility should be based on backend modules and permissions. It should not show pages for APIs that are not available.

## Seller Panel Integration Design

The seller panel should use the same API standards as the admin panel. Seller APIs should be grouped by seller workflows.

Seller panel should support these workflows:

- Seller login.
- Seller onboarding profile.
- Seller KYC submission.
- Seller dashboard.
- Seller profile management.
- Business address, pickup address, and bank details.
- Product create/update/list.
- Inventory and pricing updates.
- Seller order list.
- Seller order processing.
- Seller sub-admin management.
- Commission and payout reports.
- Notification preferences.

Seller sub-admins should only see seller modules assigned by the seller owner or authorized seller admin.

## Customer Web and Seller Web Integration Design

The customer web app is primarily for buyers. It should support browsing, account management, cart, checkout, payment, orders, returns, wallet, subscriptions, notifications, loyalty, warranty, recommendations, and CMS pages.

Seller users may log in from the web app, but seller business actions must remain in the dedicated seller admin panel. The web app should only show seller read-only status and tracking screens.

Seller web should use only these seller-specific read APIs:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/sellers/me/status` | Show seller account status, onboarding status, KYC status, checklist, next steps, and message that actions live in the seller panel |
| GET | `/api/v1/sellers/me/tracking` | Show seller order status and delivery/e-way-bill tracking summary with filters |
| GET | `/api/v1/sellers/me/tracking/:orderId` | Show seller-specific order items and delivery tracking detail |

Seller tracking query parameters:

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | Filter by order status such as `confirmed`, `packed`, `shipped`, `delivered`, `cancelled`, or `returned` |
| `deliveryStatus` | Filter by delivery/e-way-bill status such as `initiated`, `picked_up`, `in_transit`, `out_for_delivery`, `delivered`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `not_created` |
| `fromDate`, `toDate` | Filter orders by creation date |
| `limit`, `offset` | Paginate seller tracking results |

Seller web must not expose these seller-panel actions:

- Product create, update, or delete.
- Seller profile, address, bank, or settings updates.
- Seller sub-admin creation or module management.
- Order status updates.
- E-way bill creation or status updates.
- Commission calculation or payout processing.

Seller web login should route users based on role:

- `buyer`: customer account, cart, checkout, orders, returns, wallet, loyalty, warranty.
- `seller`: seller status and tracking pages, with links or labels pointing to the dedicated seller panel for actions.
- `seller-sub-admin`: seller status and tracking pages only when the account is allowed to access the related seller module.
- `admin`, `sub-admin`, `super-admin`: admin panel only, not customer web workflows.

## Third-Party Integration Design

Third-party APIs must be called from the backend only. The admin and seller panels should never store third-party API keys.

### Payment Gateway

Recommended providers:

- Razorpay
- Stripe
- Cashfree

Required backend work:

- Create payment order.
- Verify payment signature.
- Handle webhook.
- Store payment status.
- Retry failed payment events.
- Link payment to order.

Admin panel needs:

- Payment list.
- Payment status.
- Failed payment visibility.
- Chargeback list if enabled.

### Shipping and Logistics

Recommended providers:

- Shiprocket
- Delhivery
- Ecom Express

Required backend work:

- Check serviceability.
- Create shipment.
- Track shipment.
- Cancel shipment.
- Store shipment status history.
- Handle logistics webhook.

Admin panel needs:

- Shipment status visibility.
- Order delivery status.
- Failed shipment view.

Seller panel needs:

- Order shipment status.
- Pickup status.
- Tracking number.

### Email, SMS, and WhatsApp

Recommended providers:

- SendGrid or AWS SES for email.
- MSG91, Twilio, or Gupshup for SMS/WhatsApp.

Required backend work:

- OTP messages.
- Order confirmation.
- Payment success/failure.
- Seller approval/rejection.
- Return/refund updates.
- Payout notifications.

### File Storage

Recommended providers:

- AWS S3
- Cloudinary

Required backend work:

- Product image upload.
- KYC document upload.
- Invoice storage.
- Return proof images.
- File validation and size checks.

## Database and System Design

The backend should keep module ownership clear.

| Storage | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| MongoDB | Users, products, carts, notifications, analytics, audit logs |
| PostgreSQL | Orders, payments, seller KYC, payouts, transactional records |
| Redis | Cache, queues, token/session support |
| Elasticsearch | Product search |

Important design rules:

- Controllers should only handle request/response.
- Services should contain business logic.
- Repositories should handle database queries.
- Validation should stay in validation files.
- Modules should communicate through services, not direct database access.
- Webhooks should be idempotent.
- Payment, order, payout, and refund operations should be logged.
- Admin actions should be audit logged.

## Timeline for Three Developers
